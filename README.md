##Comic Book Organizer

####This is a rails site for managing your comic book collection

You can view a live version of this site on [heroku](http://desolate-garden-7034.herokuapp.com/).

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/build-your-own-site) was meant to give us free practice to help solidify our understanding of Rails.
